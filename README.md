# About
This project is a guide and files to convert an old eeePC to an OctoPrint station in order to manage my 3D printer in my workshop.

# Prerequities
## Hardware
I have an old Asus EeePC T101MT, with a touchscreen. The battery is dead, but everything else is working fine (touchscreen, keyboard, touchpad, network...). As I'm not using it anymore, it would be great to give it a second life, by making it a control station for my 3D Printer (ANET A8).

This will let me control the printer when I'm close to it, with the EeePC touchscreen, and also when I'm away, via network.

And to be perfect, adding a webcam will be great to check regularly if printing is not going wrong.

## Software
### OS
The EeePC is an old and not powerfull computer, so I will use a small linux distribution, like an ubuntu server, and launch a standalone X server with no window manager, only the tool to control the printer.

### Printer control
I'll use OctoPrint (TOTO: add a link) because I could use it localy (displaying it in a chromium) and remotely (on my desktop computer, or smartphone, even when I'm not at home).
